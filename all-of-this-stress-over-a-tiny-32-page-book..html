                All of this stress over a tiny 32 page book

            <small>Richard 2nd August July 2017</small>
            <p>
              <img src="guitarandpassport.png" class="blogphoto">
              It's Friday morning on 14th July and I have just overslept. The previous night I had decided to leave my hostel and get my Shinkansen (high speed train) from Hakata to Osaka and then Kansai airport. It's now a desperate rush to the train station in the sweltering summer heat that is Japan at this time of the year. My suitcase has a wheel missing and the sun is burning heavily through my resistance by mid day.
              </br></br>
              An hour of travel and dragging my suitcase across various surfaces of the busy city in Fukuoka sees me at the Shinkansen train office to reserve my seat. The air is full of different smells from all the underground restaurants that exist in this part of the station. My mind is clouded while my stomach grumbles and then I realise - In my haste to leave the hostel along with all the other travel logistics running through my mind, I have somehow overlooked the most essential item of any non-domestic traveler. 
              </br></br>
              After rushing all the way back to my hostel with my suitcase, which by this point seems as if it is auditioning for a "talent" show on the basis of its squeaky singing, I find my passport nestling down the side of my mattress. 
              I may have acquired my right to go through airport security with only a few human rights violated, but now I also have the thrill of rushing to an almost unbearable level to look forward to. I've had many moments like this in my life. Most of which are more serious than missing a plane flight. Everything is against me, and I gain more strength as things continue to pile on the list going wrong in this situation.
              </br></br> 
              I have an hour less travel time
              </br></br>
              I am going to make it.
              </br></br>
              There is a long wait at the ticket office.
              </br></br>
              I'm going to make it.
              </br></br>
              The train is a slower one and not the express
              </br></br>
              I'm going to make it! 
              </br></br>
              I'm dehydrated with this splitting headache.
              </br></br>
              I'm going to make it
              </br></br>
              The reclining feature on the train seat is broken, (boo hoo.) ;)
              </br></br>
              Hell yeah! I am making it! 
              </br></br>
              My train journey to airport is nearly over five hours long, and all the while I mentally prepare every change over and the reasonable amount of time I can allow. By the time I arrive at the airport, the flight is in its final board call. The woman working at the checkin counter for philippine airlines assures me I have missed the flight and that there is no point checking my luggage through. I calmly stress to her that my luggage Is getting checked and I will make the flight. They laugh as I also inform them of my plans to take my guitar on their spacious aircraft. "It's too big to take on board, Sir.” 
              </br></br>
              "You let me worry about that when I go through the gate." 
              </br></br>
              Laughing at the musician who is about to have a harsh sap of reality smacked into him, they oblige and let me it through. I dash to my gate. 
              </br></br>
              Flight attendants often have a habit of lying about about checkin times and gate closures. So often that I actually dare myself sometimes to walk to the gate when I have five minutes left “officially” to get the flight. I just wish I had the nerve to call their bluff this time because I arrived exhausted and dismayed to see the boarding process had not even started yet.
              </br></br>
              <b>A staff member comes over to me and tries to take my guitar from my tight grip.</b>
              "Would you like to give this to me so I can put it in the luggage hold?"
              "No. I wouldn't. Do you mind if I take it on board?"
              </br></br>
              "I'm afraid that is impossible, Sir. The luggage restrictions prevent us from doing so." 
              </br></br>
              "Can you then check it in the luggage at the gate, and then give it back it to me when we land at the other gate?” 
              </br></br>
              "I'm afraid not. It must be checked now.” 
              </br></br>
              "But that is ridiculous! I'm not putting such a fragile item down that conveyor belt. It'll get destroyed!" 
              </br></br>
              "Due to security issues we can't take it on board.” 
              </br></br>
              "What security issues? What on earth is more dangerous about a tiny travel guitar that fits in the overhead than your average suitcase? You know I paid almost two hundred pounds extra to fly with your company because I did not have the expectations of having to deal with such pedantic staff... <b>and so on</b></br></br>
              "Sir. Please calm down."
              </br></br>
              <b>a few seconds later</b>
              </br></br>
              "You are not putting my guitar in the hold..."
              </br></br>
              Five minutes later I have arrived at the door of the plane escorted by three airport staff in an attempt to argue my case of taking on board a my prohibited dangerous article. 
              </br></br>
              It's a very boring exchange. I allow them their lecture me about how I am "a very naughty boy", and in doing so manage to take it on board. Finally, the international crisis is averted and we are in the air. In relief I crumple into the corner of the window and surprisingly with ease drift off to sleep. In that moment of the exhaustion and stress being lifted, the cold plastic window feels almost as comfy as my bed at home. It is not a cold plastic window with air pressure aiding in the thickening of my blood and the blocking of my ears. it is a cushy pillow with a gentle extractor fan, and the turbulence is just an electric muscle-relaxing chair. So I will leave you with some words of useless advice one of your parents probably told you once in a fruitless attempt to prevent the unimaginable from happening on one of these days:
              </br></br>
              Don’t forget your passport!
